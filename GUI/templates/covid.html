<body>
	<h2 style="color: grey;">What is corona virus</h2>
	<p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">What is COVID-19</h2>
<p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">What are the symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">How does COVID-19 spread</h2>
<p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
who is sick.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h2>
<p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
spread?”</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h2>
<p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">Should I worry about COVID-19?</h2>
<p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
affect them and their loved ones.</p>
<p>We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
movement and gatherings.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">Should I wear mask to protect myself</h2>
<p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
wisely.</p>
<p>We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
<h2 style="color: grey;">How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h2>
<p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).</p>
<p>If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
